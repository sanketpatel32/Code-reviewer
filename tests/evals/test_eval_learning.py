"""Eval suite for the learning loop — runs against a real LLM.

Exercises the full feedback → synthesis → review pipeline:

  1. Seed feedback events (human comments + accept/reject signals)
  2. Run synthesis (`synthesize_rules` + `synthesize_from_human_reviews`)
  3. Verify rules emerged with the expected character
  4. Run a review on a target diff and verify the rules influenced output

Skipped when LLM API keys are not available. Run with:
