"""Language-keyed framework footgun knowledge injected into the review prompt.

Static knowledge that an LLM trained on a snapshot of the world reliably
benefits from being reminded of: subtle bugs that are easy to miss because
they look correct at a glance. Keep entries terse and copy-paste-able into
a single prompt section.

To extend: add an entry under the relevant language. Each rule should
describe the bug, not the fix — the model is good at fixes once it
recognises the pattern.
